			<dt><b>French Bulldog</b></dt></th>
			<td><dd>The one-of-a-kind French Bulldog, with his large bat ears and even disposition, is one of the world's most popular small-dog breeds, especially among city dwellers. The Frenchie is playful, alert, adaptable, and completely irresistible. The French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog in miniature, except for the large, erect 'bat ears' that are the breed's trademark feature. The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular. The bright, affectionate Frenchie is a charmer. Dogs of few words, Frenchies don't bark much'Â¿but their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs. They happily adapt to life with singles, couples, or families, and do not require a lot of outdoor exercise. They get on well with other animals and enjoy making new friends of the human variety. It is no wonder that city folk from Paris to Peoria swear by this vastly amusing and companionable breed.</dd></td>

			<dt><b>American Bulldog</b></dt></th>
			<td><dd>American Bulldogs are a well-balanced athletic dog that demonstrate great strength, endurance, agility, and a friendly attitude. Historically, they were bred to be a utility dog used for working the farm. The American Bulldog is a descendant of the English Bulldog. It is believed that the bulldog was in America as early as the 17th century. They came to the United States in the 1800s, with immigrants who brought their working bulldogs with them. Small farmers and ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock dogs, and catch dogs. The breed largely survived, particularly in the southern states, due to its ability to bring down and catch feral pigs. The breed we know as the American Bulldog was originally known by many different names before the name American Bulldog became the standard. In different parts of the South he was known as the White English Southern Bulldog, but most commonly just "bulldog." The breed was not called a bulldog because of a certain look, but because they did real bulldog work.</dd></td>

			<dt><b>English Bulldog</b></dt></th>
			<td><dd>The English bulldog is a brawny little powerhouse whose characteristic crablike waddle exudes great strength, stability and vigor. The dog's head is large and spherical, and the muzzle is extremely short, giving the face a flattened appearance. The English bulldog's eyes are dark and set low and wide on the forehead in the frontal plane. The nose is black and slightly upturned. The jaws (or "chops") are massive, broad and undershot. The lower jaw juts out in front of the upper jaw to scarcely expose the lower incisors, producing a comical grin. The lips are fleshy and pendulous. The cheeks are well rounded and protrude sideways. The ears are thin, small and angle forward like flaps that frame the forehead. The various color patterns are brindle, piebald, and solid white, red, fawn or fallow.</dd></td>

			<dt><b>Australian Bulldog</b></dt></th>
			<td><dd>An Australian Bulldog can be as happy in a city as in a house with a backyard as long as they receive proper food, exercise, and attention, according to Pet Guide. Like all other bulldogs, they love being part of a family and won't leave your side. They are affectionate, loyal, and intelligent dogs who weigh between 50 and 78 pounds. These bulldogs were bred to adapt to the Australian environment (as their breed name suggests), which means they may be more active than their cousins but aren't the most active dog out there.</dd></td>
